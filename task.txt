Ferroelectric capacitance and current measurement system

Large signal capacitance measurement enhancement for PicoIRIS board.
PicoIRIS

Key technical and user specifications:
Should have:
a) Triangular waverform generator (up to 100 kHz), +/- 5V peak-peak
b) Minimum measurable charge: 1 pC (or at least a few 100 pC)

Deliverable expected at end of the semester:
Working prototype of the ferroelectric capacitance measurement unit
